Create smart, rule-based **playlists and collections** in Jellyfin.

## 🙏 Credits

This project is based on the original SmartPlaylist plugin created by **[ankenyr](https://github.com/ankenyr)**. You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/ankenyr/jellyfin-smartplaylist-plugin). All credit for the foundational work and the core idea goes to him.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The vast majority of the recent features, including the entire web interface and the underlying API changes in this plugin, were developed by an AI assistant. While I do have some basic experience with C# from a long time ago, I'm essentially the project manager, guiding the AI, fixing its occasional goofs, and trying to keep it from becoming self-aware.
